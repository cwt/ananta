# Contributor Code of Conduct

Hey there! I’m thrilled you’re up for helping with my project. It’s just me running things, but I’d love to see your fixes and pull requests. Let’s keep it friendly and make this a great experience for everyone.

## What We’re About
- Be kind and respectful, even when we don’t agree.
- Share feedback constructively and take it in stride.
- Made a mistake? Just apologize, and we’ll keep going.
- Focus on making the project better for all.

## What to Avoid
- No rude or hurtful comments, trolling, or personal attacks.
- Don’t share anyone’s private info without their permission.
- Keep things appropriate—no offensive or uncomfortable behavior.

## Handling Issues
If something’s off (like a comment or contribution), I’ll:
- Reach out privately to clear things up.
- If it continues, I might ask for a pause on contributing.
- In rare cases, I may need to stop further contributions.

Got a concern? Message me directly, and I’ll handle it fairly and privately.

## Where This Applies
This covers the repo, issues, pull requests, and anywhere you’re representing the project.

## Let’s Build Together
Treat everyone with respect, and we’ll create something awesome. Thanks for contributing!

(Based on the Contributor Covenant, but simplified for our small crew.)
