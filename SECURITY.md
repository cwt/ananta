**Note**: Security fixes are applied to the current development (HEAD/tip) first. A new tagged release will follow to incorporate these updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security issues via public GitHub Issues or SourceHut Tickets. Instead, email vulnerabilities to my email address listed in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file. Include:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- Potential impact.

As this is a *single person* project, I aim to acknowledge your report within **7 days** and will keep you updated on the resolution process.

## Disclosure

I follow a **coordinated disclosure** process. Please give me time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
Once resolved, vulnerabilities will be announced with credits to the reporter, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
